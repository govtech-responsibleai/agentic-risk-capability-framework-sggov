As a result, the system may violate privacy obligations, expose individuals to harm, or breach data protection requirements. element_id: CAP-04 failure_mode: Agent Failure type: - Safety - Security controls: - CTRL-0048 sources: - https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2025-04/ai-privacy-risks-and-mitigations-in-llms.pdf wog_description: Government agents process vast amounts of citizen PII including NRIC numbers, addresses, income information, medical records, and family details. Agents that regurgitate PII from training data, memory, or prior sessions could expose citizen information inappropriately. While public agencies have exemptions from PDPA, they are still bound by Public Sector Governance Act requirements and the Government Instruction Manual on data protection. wog_examples: - Agent trained on historical citizen correspondence inadvertently reproduces NRIC numbers and addresses from training data when generating template responses - Content generation agent includes real citizen names and details from processed applications when creating example documentation for training purposes\nRISK-028: statement: Generation of non-factual or hallucinated content description: This risk arises when an agent generates information that is inaccurate, fabricated, or unsupported by evidence while presenting it as factual. As a result, users may be misled, make incorrect decisions, or lose trust in the system's outputs. element_id: CAP-04 failure_mode: Agent Failure type: - Safety controls: - CTRL-0049 - CTRL-0050 - CTRL-0051 sources: - https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01219 wog_description: Government agents must provide accurate information as citizens rely on official sources for critical decisions about housing, retirement, healthcare, and legal matters. Hallucinated policy details, incorrect eligibility criteria, or fabricated procedures could cause citizens to miss application deadlines, misunderstand their entitlements, or take actions based on false information. This undermines the reliability of digital government services. wog_examples: - CPF agent confidently states incorrect withdrawal age limits that were changed in recent policy updates, causing citizens to delay legitimate withdrawals - IRAS agent fabricates tax relief categories that don't exist in Singapore tax code, leading taxpayer to claim invalid deductions\nRISK-029: statement: Generation of copyrighted content description: This risk arises when an agent generates content that reproduces or closely resembles copyrighted material without appropriate rights or attribution. As a result, the system may infringe intellectual property laws, expose the organisation to legal liability, or violate licensing and usage terms. element_id: CAP-04 failure_mode: Agent Failure type: - Safety controls: - CTRL-0052 sources: - https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07087 wog_description: Government agents generating content for official communications, educational materials, or public engagement must avoid reproducing copyrighted material. Singapore's Copyright Act applies to government use, and agencies must respect intellectual property rights. Agents generating content that infringes copyright could expose agencies to legal liability and reputational damage. wog_examples: - Government content agent reproduces substantial portions of copyrighted news articles in public communications without proper licensing or attribution - Creative content agent for National Day communications generates music or artwork that closely resembles copyrighted works\nRISK-030: statement: Misrepresentation of authorship description: This risk arises when recipients are misled about whether an official communication was authored by a human or generated by an agent on behalf of the organisation. As a result, stakeholders may form incorrect assumptions about accountability, intent, or authority, potentially leading to trust, legal, or reputational issues. element_id: CAP-05 failure_mode: Agent Failure type: - Safety controls: - CTRL-0053 sources: - https://fortune.com/article/customer-support-ai-cursor-went-rogue/ wog_description: Government communications carry legal and administrative weight. Citizens receiving official letters, notices, or responses expect these to reflect considered human judgement by accountable officers. Misrepresenting AI-generated content as human-authored undermines this trust relationship and may create issues when citizens seek to appeal decisions or hold officers accountable. wog_examples: - AI-generated enforcement notice from LTA is formatted and signed in a way that implies human officer review and approval when automated, creating accountability confusion when citizen appeals\nRISK-031: statement: Inaccurate promises or statements in official communications description: This risk arises when an agent makes commitments, assurances, or public statements that are incorrect, unsupported, or exceed the organisation's actual intentions or capabilities. As a result, the organisation may face reputational damage, legal exposure, or loss of public trust due to unmet expectations or misinformation. element_id: CAP-05 failure_mode: Agent Failure type: - Safety controls: - CTRL-0054 - CTRL-0055 - CTRL-0056 sources: - https://the-decoder.com/people-buy-brand-new-chevrolets-for-1-from-a-chatgpt-chatbot/ wog_description: Government agents making official communications must not make promises or commitments that exceed their authority or agency capabilities. Incorrect statements about processing timelines, guaranteed outcomes, or special arrangements could create legitimate expectations that agencies cannot fulfil, potentially exposing the government to legal challenges or damaging public trust in official communications. wog_examples: - HDB enquiry agent promises specific flat allocation to citizen based on incorrect understanding of priority rules, creating legitimate expectation that cannot be honoured - Grant application agent commits to specific timeline that exceeds the agency's actual processing capabilities\nRISK-032: statement: Unauthorised execution of business transactions description: This risk arises when an agent initiates, authorises, or executes business transactions outside predefined approval thresholds, roles, or authorisation limits. As a result, the organisation may be exposed to unintended financial losses, binding contractual obligations, or operational commitments that were not properly sanctioned. element_id: CAP-06 failure_mode: Agent Failure type: - Security controls: - CTRL-0057 - CTRL-0058 sources: - https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2025/05/29/ai-agents-vulnerable-financial-attacks wog_description: Government agents with transaction capabilities must operate within the approval limits and delegation authorities defined by the agency. Unauthorised transactions\u2014whether grant disbursements, procurement commitments, or payment authorisations\u2014could result in improper use of public funds and audit findings. wog_examples: - Agent processes payment exceeding the officer's delegation limit without routing for appropriate approval, creating unauthorised commitment of public funds - GeBIZ procurement agent generates purchase orders that bypass required quotation thresholds for the transaction amount - Grant disbursement agent approves MSF assistance payments without proper means-testing verification, resulting in overpayments that require recovery action\nRISK-033: statement: Leakage of transaction credentials description: This risk arises when credentials, tokens, or sensitive authentication information used to execute business transactions are exposed, mishandled, or improperly stored by an agent or its supporting systems. As a result, malicious parties may gain the ability to initiate unauthorised transactions, manipulate financial operations, or compromise transactional systems. element_id: CAP-06 failure_mode: Tool or Resource Malfunction type: - Security controls: - CTRL-0059 - CTRL-0060 sources: - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.01055 wog_description: Government transaction credentials provide access to public funds and sensitive operations. Credential leakage could enable fraudulent transactions, unauthorised procurement, or manipulation of financial systems. IM8 security requirements mandate strict credential protection. wog_examples: - Agent logs payment authorisation tokens in verbose debug output that is captured in centralised logging system accessible to developers, enabling potential credential theft - Procurement agent includes GeBIZ signing credentials in its error messages when transactions fail, exposing credentials that could be used to create unauthorised purchase orders - Grant disbursement agent caches fund transfer credentials in plaintext memory, which could be extracted if the agent's runtime environment is compromised\nRISK-034: statement: Prompt injection via malicious websites description: This risk arises when an agent retrieves or processes content from malicious or untrusted websites that are designed to inject instructions or manipulative prompts into the system. As a result, the agent may follow unintended commands, override intended constraints, or take actions that compromise system behaviour or integrity. element_id: CAP-07 failure_mode: External Manipulation type: - Safety - Security controls: - CTRL-0061 - CTRL-0062 - CTRL-0063 sources: - https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/agentic-ai-threats/ wog_description: Government agents with internet access capabilities may retrieve content from websites for research, verification, or information augmentation. Malicious websites could embed prompt injection attacks in their content to manipulate agent behaviour\u2014potentially causing agents to leak sensitive data, bypass security controls, or take unauthorised actions. This risk extends to government agents accessing external databases, news sources, or reference materials. wog_examples: - MTI trade research agent retrieves information from compromised business website containing hidden instructions that cause agent to email sensitive trade negotiation details to external address - Agent verifying company information through web search encounters malicious page designed to override agent's instructions and extract information about pending government contracts - Policy research agent accessing international organisation website retrieves page with embedded prompt injection that manipulates subsequent analysis outputs\nRISK-035: statement: Unreliable information or websites description: This risk arises when an agent retrieves and presents information from websites that are inaccurate, outdated, biased, or otherwise unreliable. As a result, users may be misinformed or make incorrect decisions based on content that has not been adequately validated or corroborated. element_id: CAP-07 failure_mode: Tool or Resource Malfunction type: - Safety controls: - CTRL-0064 sources: - https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/googles-ai-overviews-are-often-so-confidently-wrong-that-ive-lost-all-trust-in-them wog_description: Government agents providing information to citizens or supporting policy research must ensure accuracy and reliability. Retrieving information from unreliable sources could lead to incorrect policy advice, misinformed citizen guidance, or flawed analysis. wog_examples: - Research agent preparing policy brief retrieves statistics from unreliable source that contradict official SingStat data, introducing inaccuracies into government analysis - Citizen enquiry agent augments response with information from outdated third-party website that no longer reflects current government policy\nRISK-036: statement: Prompt injection risks through computer use description: This risk arises when an agent interacts with graphical user interfaces that display untrusted or adversarial content - such as web pages, documents, pop-ups, or form fields - crafted to embed hidden instructions or manipulative cues. As a result, the agent may misinterpret on-screen text as authoritative guidance, follow injected instructions, or perform unintended actions while operating the interface. element_id: CAP-08 failure_mode: External Manipulation type: - Safety - Security controls: - CTRL-0065 - CTRL-0066 sources: - https://arxiv.org/html/2505.13076v1 - https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/indirect-prompt-injection-of-claude-computer-use/ wog_description: Government agents with computer use capabilities operating desktop interfaces may encounter adversarial content displayed on screen.
