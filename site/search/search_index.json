Designed for teams managing risks throughout the organisation and product lifecycle who need structured governance without heavy certification overhead.                       Broad AI actors                       AI actors (organisations &amp; individuals) across all sectors voluntarily using the framework. Use-case agnostic and sector-neutral, intended as foundational guidance for anyone designing, developing, or deploying AI systems. Broad applicability but less specialised for agentic contexts.                       Regulators &amp; providers/users                       Providers and users of AI in the EU; regulators and compliance officers enforcing the Act. Mandatory for high-risk AI system providers placing products on EU market and deployers using AI in the EU. Clear regulatory audience with legal obligations.                       Multi-stakeholder (policy)                       Policymakers, oversight bodies, and governance leads designing governance structures. More conceptual than operationally focused, serving those setting governance policy and defining oversight mechanisms. Less useful for frontline implementation teams.                       Security engineers &amp; practitioners                       Security engineers, red teams, and blue teams building and defending agentic applications.

Focuses on practitioners who need layered architectural guidance for building and securing agentic systems with defence-in-depth approaches.               Unit of Analysis     \u25ba What is the main governance object or focal point              Capability\u2013risk mapping                       Capabilities with components and system design. Organises governance around what the system can do (capabilities) and maps these to specific risks and controls. Focuses on the powers the system possesses (e.g., internet access, file system access, code execution) as the primary unit for risk analysis.                       Lifecycle risk functions                       AI systems and lifecycle stages organised into four functions: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage. Categories and subcategories within each function provide structure. Lifecycle-oriented approach addresses systems broadly across development and deployment phases.                       Risk categories (tiered)                       AI systems defined by risk category: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal risk. High-risk AI triggers compliance obligations. Agentic systems recognised as spanning ecosystems with continuous risk profiles requiring dynamic oversight.                       Continuous dimensions                       Continuous dimensions of decision authority, process autonomy, and accountability. Analyses how control and responsibility shift as systems move along these dimensions towards greater autonomy. Conceptual lens rather than concrete system components.                       Threat/attack surfaces                       Threats and attack surfaces for agent workflows organised by component: reasoning loops, memory systems, tool use, identity/permissions, oversight mechanisms, and multi-agent interactions. Security-first perspective analysing where vulnerabilities exist.                       Principles &amp; control families                       Principles and control families across the agent lifecycle. Organises security around core principles (human controller, limited powers, observability) and associated control families. Strategic rather than granular component analysis.                       Layered architecture                       Layered security architecture analysing threats at each layer of agentic systems. Examines security across model layer, agent layer, and application layer with layer-specific threat models and controls. Defence-in-depth architectural view.               Prescriptiveness     \u25ba Level of detailed requirements vs. high-level principles              Medium\u2013High                       Structured risk\u2192control mapping with implementation checklists and governance workflows. Provides detailed guidance on selecting controls based on capability profiles and risk thresholds. Not legally binding or certifiable but highly structured with clear decision points.                       Low                       Voluntary guidance with tasks and outcomes but not prescriptive in implementation. Provides categories, subcategories, and suggested actions that organisations adapt to their context. Not certifiable or legally binding. High-level principles requiring significant interpretation.                       High                       Legally binding requirements with strict obligations for high-risk AI. Mandatory policies, documentation, conformity assessments, logging, transparency, and human oversight. Non-compliance results in significant penalties. Most prescriptive framework with clear legal requirements.                       Low\u2013Medium                       Conceptual thresholds with limited concrete controls. Provides framework for thinking about governance dimensions and thresholds but offers few specific implementation requirements or control specifications. Requires significant interpretation and operationalisation.                       Medium\u2013High                       Enumerated threats with specific mitigation strategies. Provides catalogue of concrete threats and corresponding mitigation techniques. More prescriptive than conceptual frameworks with actionable security guidance, though allows implementation flexibility.                       Medium                       Principle-led control families rather than detailed requirements. Provides security principles and control families offering structure for security architects to design implementations, but requires organisational interpretation and adaptation. Not a full specification.                       Medium                       Layer-specific threat models with risk-based control guidance. Provides structured approach to identifying and mitigating threats at each architectural layer.

Provides structured artifacts for analysing security at model, agent, and application layers with corresponding control implementations.               Control Selection Logic     \u25ba How safeguards are selected and prioritised              Capability- &amp; risk-based thresholds                       Controls selected by capability profile and deployment context. Uses impact\u00d7likelihood thresholds to determine minimum control sets. Tailored to specific capabilities (e.g., internet access requires different controls than file system access). Tiered control levels scale with risk.                       Risk-based &amp; flexible                       Organisations identify, measure, and prioritise risks contextually.

Dimensional thresholds                       By dimensional thresholds where higher autonomy requires stricter oversight. Suggests that as systems move towards greater autonomy along dimensions, oversight requirements increase. Provides conceptual logic but not specific risk\u2192control mappings or control catalogues.                       Threat-driven                       Controls selected based on threat presence and attack surface. For example, tool misuse threats require sandboxing and least-privilege access; memory threats require input validation and integrity checks. Direct mapping from identified threats to specific mitigations.                       Principle-aligned (defence-in-depth)                       Control selection guided by core principles: limit powers, ensure observability, maintain human controller. Dynamic least-privilege limits agent powers; observability requirements ensure plan/action monitoring; human-in-the-loop for critical decisions. Hybrid defence approach.                       Risk-based layered controls                       Layer-specific risk assessment driving control selection at each architectural layer.

Controls must clearly state what actions are to be taken on what, by whom, and by when. Each control also needs to be written modularly, so they can be combined with other controls, and be easy to validate when it is implemented correctly. Writing controls in an active voice and using imperatives will help.</li> <li>Map each control to at least one risk in the Risk Register. Controls must be useful in mitigating the identified risks in the Risk Register. Even general hygiene controls should be linked to the appropriate baseline risks (either from the components or design of the agentic system). </li> <li>Build or recommend tools for implementing these controls. Controls are useful in defining what standards need to be met, but they can also be very onerous on developers. Tools help to reduce the compliance workload, and recommending suitable open-source tools can make these controls more tolerable.</li> </ol> Is it possible to have a risk without a control in the Risk Register? <p>Yes! This is to document novel risks where there are no known effective controls, and to ensure that these risks are accounted for in the agentic system's risk assessment. As there are no recommended controls, development teams must decide whether the residual risk (see below) is too much to accept.</p> Is it possible for a single control to tackle multiple risks? <p>Yes!

Concretely, autonomy + tool access shifts the risk profile from \u201cbad text output\u201d to real-world actions:</p> <ul> <li>Destructive or unauthorised actions: agents can take irreversible operational steps (e.g., deleting or modifying critical resources) when permissions are broad or approvals are bypassed (case study: Replit\u2019s AI coding assistant reportedly wiped a production database during a code freeze).</li> <li>Command misinterpretation at the system boundary: agents operating terminals/filesystems can translate ambiguous intent into catastrophic OS-level commands (case study: an \u201cAntigravity\u201d agent reportedly deleted a developer\u2019s D: drive while \u201cclearing cache\u201d).</li> <li>Adversarial manipulation of agent tool-use: attackers can shape what tools an agent calls (or how it interprets tool interfaces), causing harmful downstream decisions (case study: FuncPoison\u2014poisoning function/tool libraries to hijack multi-agent behaviour).</li> </ul> <p>Governing agentic systems presents unique challenges \u2014 their autonomy to execute diverse actions introduces substantially broader risk profiles. The space of possible tool calls, action sequences, and environment interactions is large and often context-dependent, making failure modes harder to anticipate and audit than for text-only systems. Whilst in-depth risk assessments for each system are possible, doing so for every deployment, configuration change, and new capability does not scale. </p> <p>The Agentic Risk &amp; Capability (ARC) framework addresses this challenge as a technical governance framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating safety and security risks in agentic systems. The framework examines where and how risks emerge, contextualises risks given domain and use case, and recommends technical controls for mitigation. Whilst not comprehensive, it provides a systematic, scalable foundation for managing agentic AI risks.</p> Existing Literature on Agentic AI Governance <p>High-level regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act and NIST AI RMF Playbook, are effective at outlining key principles for managing AI risks and provide a shared vocabulary and baseline expectations across organisations, but they lack specific focus on agentic AI and actionable technical measures for risk identification, assessment, and management.</p> <p>We position ARC within technical AI governance: developing practical analysis and tools that support effective governance (see Reuel et al., 2025). Closely related work includes TRiSM for agentic AI (Raza et al., 2025) and dimensional governance (Engin &amp; Hand, 2025), which frames oversight along decision authority, process autonomy, and accountability.</p> <p>Cybersecurity-oriented frameworks (MAESTRO, OWASP Agentic AI \u2013 Threats and Mitigations, NVIDIA: Agentic Autonomy Levels and Security) apply threat modelling to agentic systems (e.g., data poisoning, tool compromise, agent impersonation).
