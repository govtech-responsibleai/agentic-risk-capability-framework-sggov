# Elements of agentic systems

!!! abstract "Page Summary"

    This page defines the three analytical elements used to assess agentic systems: components (LLM, tools, instructions, memory), design (architecture, access controls, monitoring), and capabilities (cognitive, interaction, operational). It provides a detailed taxonomy serving as a reference for identifying elements during risk assessment.

Across all agentic systems, there are three indispensable elements to examine:
**(1)** the components of an agent,
**(2)** the design of the agentic system, and
**(3)** the capabilities of the agentic system.

## Components

Components are essential parts of a single, standalone agent.
Here, we synthesise prevailing agreement on the key components of an agent from various sources, such as [**OpenAI**](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf), [**LangChain**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/), [**Anthropic**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use), and [**AWS**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html).

* **🧠 LLM**: A large language model (LLM) is a neural network trained on massive text data to learn statistical patterns of language, enabling it to understand, generate, and reason over natural language inputs. It is the core reasoning engine that processes instructions, interprets user inputs, and generates contextually appropriate responses by leveraging its trained language understanding and generation capabilities. There are a large variety of LLMs to choose from, with different sizes, capabilities, and architectures, from large closed-source LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-5.2, Anthropic's Claude 4 Opus, or Gemini 3 Pro, to smaller open-weights models like Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen3 8B, and Mistral Small 3.1.

* **📋 Instructions**: Instructions are structured inputs provided to an LLM that define the task, constraints, and context, guiding how the model interprets inputs and generates outputs. They guide the LLM's decision process by conditioning prompts and tool use with objectives, policies, and guardrails. Forms include system prompts, policies, schemas, and rubrics, varying by framework and enforcement strictness.

* **🔧 Tools**: Tools are external functions, APIs, or resources attached to an LLM that extend its capabilities beyond text generation, enabling it to retrieve information, execute actions, and affect external systems (e.g., search, code execution, database queries, or file manipulation), typically through structured interfaces such as the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) that constrain invocation, inputs, permissions, and outputs for agentic control and safety.

* **💾 Memory**: Memory is a persistent or semi-persistent data store attached to an LLM that retains information across interactions—such as conversation history, user preferences, task state, and retrieved knowledge—enabling continuity, long-horizon reasoning, and personalization in agentic workflows. Memory may be implemented through mechanisms such as context windows, vector databases, episodic logs, or external state stores, each offering different trade-offs in latency, fidelity, and persistence.

## Design

We now broaden our perspective to examine how agentic AI systems are assembled from individual agents from a system design perspective.

* **🏗️ Agentic Architecture**: The agentic architecture defines how multiple agents are structured, interconnected, and coordinated to collectively perform tasks that exceed the capabilities of a single agent. This includes orchestration patterns such as hierarchical delegation, parallel agent execution, sequential handoffs between specialised agents, shared or centralized planning components, and the communication protocols that govern information exchange and coordination across the system. Different architectures result in varying levels of system-wide risk, and these need to be considered carefully. Similarly, the communication protocols by which agents exchange information — such as the [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/) or IBM's [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://research.ibm.com/projects/agent-communication-protocol) — may also give rise to security risks.

* **🔐 Roles and Access Controls**: Roles and access controls define and enforce differentiated roles, permissions, and scopes of authority across agents and system components, specifying what actions each agent is allowed to perform and which resources it may access. This includes assigning functional roles to agents, configuring tool- and data-level permissions, scoping credentials or identities, and enforcing access policies that govern interactions with files, systems, services, or other agents.

* **📊 Monitoring and Traceability**: Monitoring and traceability provide systematic visibility into agent behaviour, interactions, and decision pathways by recording, observing, and correlating agent actions and system events over time. This includes logging agent inputs and outputs, tracking tool invocations and state changes, capturing decision traces or execution paths, and surfacing telemetry or audit records that support analysis and review of system behaviour.

## Capabilities

We see three broad categories of capabilities — **cognitive**, **interaction**, and **operational** — which can be further broken down into more granular abilities.

### 🧩 Cognitive Capabilities

*Cognitive capabilities* encompass the agentic AI system's internal "thinking" skills — how it analyses information, forms plans, learns from experience, and monitors its own performance.

* **🎯 Planning & Goal Management**: The capability to develop detailed, step-by-step, and executable plans with specific tasks in response to broad instructions. This includes prioritizing activities based on importance and dependencies between tasks, monitoring how well its plan is working, and adjusting when circumstances change or obstacles arise.

* **👥 Agent Delegation**: The capability to assign subtasks to other agents and coordinate their activities to achieve broader goals. This includes identifying which components are best suited for specific tasks, issuing clear instructions, managing inter-agent dependencies, and monitoring performance or failures.

* **🛠️ Tool Use**: The capability to evaluate available options and choose the best tool for specific subtasks, based on the capabilities and limitations of different tools and matching them appropriately to the tasks. This includes selecting between search, computation, code execution, or domain-specific APIs, determining when tool invocation is necessary, and sequencing or combining multiple tools to complete complex tasks effectively.

### 🔗 Interaction Capabilities

*Interaction capabilities* describe how the agentic AI system exchanges information with users, other agents, and external systems. These are differentiated based on how and what they interact with.

* **💬 Multimodal Understanding & Generation**: The capability to communicate with human users across multiple modalities, including natural language conversation (explaining topics, generating documents, interactive discussions) and multimodal understanding/generation (processing and creating image, audio, or video content such as visual analysis, speech transcription, or multimedia creation).

* **📧 Official Communication**: The capability to autonomously compose, finalize, and dispatch authoritative communications that formally and legally represent an organization to external parties (e.g. customers, partners, regulators, courts, or media) via approved channels and formats, without prior human review or approval, thereby creating potential legal, regulatory, or reputational obligations. This includes sending legally binding correspondence, publishing official statements or press releases, and responding to external inquiries using the organisation's identity.

* **💳 Business Transactions**: The capability to autonomously initiate, authorise, and execute binding business transactions with external parties - such as payments, purchases, reservations, or service commitments - within predefined authorisation limits, resulting in real financial, contractual, or operational obligations for the organization. This includes processing payments or refunds, placing orders or subscriptions, booking services or reservations, and accepting or triggering contractual commitments on behalf of the organization.

* **🌐 Internet & Search Access**: The capability to autonomously access, browse, search, and retrieve information from the Internet to augment the LLM's static training knowledge with external and up-to-date sources in support of task execution and response generation. This includes issuing search queries, following and parsing web pages, extracting relevant facts or documents, and aggregating information from multiple online sources.

* **🖱️ Computer Use**: The capability to directly operate a computer's graphical user interface on behalf of the user, enabling the agent to navigate applications and execute tasks through mouse, keyboard, and window-based interactions. This includes moving the cursor, clicking buttons, entering text, using keyboard shortcuts, switching between windows and applications, and navigating files and menus within the operating system environment.

* **🔌 Other Programmatic Interfaces**: The capability to interact with external systems through non-graphical, programmatic interfaces, such as APIs, SDKs, and backend services, to exchange data or trigger actions as part of task execution. This includes calling REST or GraphQL APIs, invoking cloud services, publishing or consuming messages from queues or event streams, and performing operations such as code pushes, data updates, or system integrations across enterprise platforms.

### ⚙️ Operational Capabilities

*Operational capabilities* focus on the agentic AI system's ability to execute actions safely and efficiently within its operating environment.

* **💻 Code Execution**: The capability to write, execute, and debug code in various programming languages to automate tasks or solve computational problems. This includes implementing algorithms, writing scripts, compiling and running code, debugging errors, and integrating with external systems through APIs or backend services.

* **📁 File & Data Management**: The capability to manage the full lifecycle of files and data by creating, reading, modifying, organizing, converting, querying, and updating information across both unstructured artifacts (e.g. documents, spreadsheets, media files) and structured data stores (e.g. SQL/NoSQL databases, data warehouses, vector or embedding stores) in support of operational tasks. This includes ingesting and transforming datasets, generating or updating files, maintaining directory or schema structures, executing database queries or updates, and storing or retrieving embeddings or derived data products.

* **⚡ System Management**: The capability to directly manage and configure technical systems and infrastructure by adjusting system settings, controlling computing resources, and administering operational environments across on-premise or cloud platforms. This includes monitoring system health and performance, managing authentication credentials and access controls, provisioning or scaling compute and storage resources, configuring operating system or runtime parameters, and applying system-level optimisations to support reliable operation.
