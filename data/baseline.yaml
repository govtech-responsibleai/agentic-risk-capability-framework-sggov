BASE-01:
  name: "LLM"
  description: "The LLM is the reasoning engine that processes instructions, interprets user inputs, and generates contextually appropriate responses by leveraging its trained language understanding and generation capabilities."

BASE-02:
  name: "Instructions"
  description: "Instructions are the blueprint which defines an agent's role, capabilities, and behavioral constraints, ensuring it operates within intended parameters and maintains its performance across different scenarios."

BASE-03:
  name: "Tools"
  description: "Tools enable LLMs to interact with the external environment, be it editing files, querying databases, controlling devices, or accessing APIs. This is facilitated by MCP servers, which provide LLMs a consistent interface to discover and utilize a variety of tools."

BASE-04:
  name: "Memory"
  description: "The memory or knowledge base component provides the agent with contextual awareness and information persistence, enabling it to maintain coherent conversations, learn from past interactions, and access relevant facts without requiring constant re-instruction."

BASE-05:
  name: "Agentic Architecture"
  description: "The agentic architecture defines how multiple agents are interconnected, coordinated, and orchestrated to collectively solve complex tasks that exceed individual agent capabilities, including patterns like hierarchical delegation, parallel processing, or sequential handoffs between specialized agents. Different architectures result in varying levels of system-wide risk, and these need to be considered carefully. Similarly, the protocols by which agents communicate (e.g., A2A) may also give rise to security risks."

BASE-06:
  name: "Roles and Access Controls"
  description: "Roles and access controls establish differentiated responsibilities and permissions across agents within the system, ensuring that each agent operates within appropriate boundaries while being able to fulfill its designated function. This is critical because it limits unauthorized actions, contains the blast radius of potential failures or security breaches, and enables the system to maintain reliability even when individual agents may be compromised or behave unexpectedly."

BASE-07:
  name: "Monitoring and Traceability"
  description: "Monitoring and traceability enable visibility into agentic system behavior, interactions, and decision-making pathways, allowing developers and operators to understand what agents are doing, why they made particular choices, and how outcomes were produced. This is essential for post-hoc debugging, real-time anomaly detection, and establishing accountability particularly when agents operate with a degree of autonomy or interact with sensitive systems and data."
