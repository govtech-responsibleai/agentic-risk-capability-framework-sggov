RISK-001:
  statement: Use of untrusted or compromised LLMs
  description: This risk arises when LLMs obtained from untrusted or insufficiently
    vetted sources have been intentionally poisoned or backdoored during training
    or distribution, causing them to behave maliciously or unpredictably under specific
    conditions. Such models may leak sensitive information, bypass safeguards, or
    execute hidden behaviours that undermine system integrity and trust.

  wog_description: Agencies can access LLMs through various modalities, including GovTech's LaunchPad AI platform, GCC AI services (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock), commercial vendors, and open-source repositories like Hugging Face. When models are deployed without proper vetting through GovTech's security review process, or when fine-tuned models from external contractors are not adequately tested, agencies are exposed to risks from backdoored or poisoned models. For government systems handling citizen data via MyInfo, policy information, or operational decisions affecting Singaporeans, compromised models could leak sensitive data, generate misleading policy advice, or undermine public trust in digital government services.
  wog_examples:
    - Agency deploys open-source LLM from Hugging Face for internal document summarisation without security review via SHIP-HATS, unaware that model weights were modified to log and transmit input text containing keywords like 'classified', 'secret', or 'NRIC' to external endpoints
    - Vendor-provided fine-tuned model for citizen enquiry chatbot on LifeSG contains training data poisoning that causes it to generate misleading information about CPF withdrawal rules or HDB grant eligibility when triggered by particular phrasing
    - Agency uses unvetted model for processing Singpass-authenticated requests, where the model contains hidden behaviour that extracts and stores authentication tokens when specific prompt patterns are detected

RISK-002:
  statement: Insufficient alignment of LLM behaviour
  description: This risk arises when an LLM's learned objectives and behaviors do
    not reliably align with intended user goals, system instructions, or organizational
    policies, leading to inappropriate, unsafe, or undesired outputs. Misalignment
    may surface as failure to follow constraints, inconsistent reasoning, or behavior
    that diverges from expected norms in edge cases or complex scenarios.

  wog_description: LLMs deployed in government contexts must reliably follow public service standards, agency-specific policies, regulatory requirements. Misalignment risks are particularly acute when agents handle statutory functions, citizen-facing services, or cross-agency workflows. An LLM that fails to align with the public service values, IM8 security policies, PDPA-equivalent data handling standards for public agencies, or agency-specific missions may produce outputs that violate the public service spirit or government protocols.
  wog_examples:
    - LLM-powered MSF assistance chatbot fails to follow instruction to always refer complex hardship cases to human officers, instead attempting to resolve cases autonomously and providing incorrect ComCare eligibility assessments, due to focus on performance metrics over citizen needs
    - Citizen service agent prioritises processing speed metrics over thorough assistance, dismissing elderly citizen's complex enquiry with generic responses rather than patiently understanding their needs and providing appropriate guidance, contrary to the public service ethos of putting citizens at the heart of service delivery
    - IRAS tax advisory agent diverges from conservative interpretation policy during tax filing season, providing aggressive tax minimisation advice that contradicts official IRAS guidance and creates compliance issues for taxpayers

RISK-003:
  statement: Insufficient LLM capability and reliability
  description: This risk arises when an LLM lacks sufficient capability, robustness,
    or reasoning performance to correctly interpret instructions, handle edge cases,
    or detect unsafe situations. As a result, the model may produce incorrect, misleading,
    or unsafe outputs that create downstream safety or security failures in systems
    that rely on its judgments.

  wog_description: Government services require high reliability as errors directly impact citizens' lives. An LLM lacking sufficient capability may fail to correctly interpret complex eligibility criteria, mishandle edge cases in policy implementation, or fail to recognise when a citizen's situation requires human officer intervention. Given Singapore's high digital service adoption rate and citizen expectations for accurate government information, capability gaps can erode public trust and cause tangible harm.
  wog_examples:
    - CPF retirement planning agent lacks capability to correctly handle complex scenarios involving multiple CPF accounts, overseas employment periods, and voluntary contributions, providing retirement projections that are materially incorrect
    - MOE school placement agent fails to correctly apply the Primary 1 registration priority phases for edge cases involving citizenship changes or sibling priority rules, resulting in incorrect school allocations

RISK-004:
  statement: Weak tool authentication and authorisation controls
  description: This risk arises when tools connected to an agent lack robust authentication
    or fine-grained authorisation mechanisms, allowing unauthorised access or misuse
    of tool capabilities. As a result, attackers or misbehaving agents may compromise
    the system by invoking sensitive actions, escalating privileges, or manipulating
    external resources beyond intended boundaries.

  wog_description: Government agentic applications often integrate with multiple upstream and downstream API services to deliver end-to-end citizen services. Weak authentication or authorisation controls at any integration point can create vulnerabilities that propagate across the service chain. The interconnected nature of whole-of-government architecture means a single weak tool authentication mechanism could provide attack vectors across multiple agency systems and data sources.
  wog_examples:
    - MCP server providing citizen record lookup tools (e.g., income verification, housing status) to a grants processing agent validates tokens only at session start; when an officer's access is revoked mid-session due to role change or termination, the agent continues querying sensitive citizen financial data until the session expires hours later

RISK-005:
  statement: Lack of proper role-based access control for tools
  description: This risk arises when tools exposed to an agent do not enforce clear,
    role-based access controls, allowing agents to access capabilities or resources
    beyond their intended responsibilities. As a result, agents may perform unauthorised
    actions, misuse sensitive tools, or exceed their permitted scope, increasing the
    likelihood of security and operational failures.

  wog_description: Government agents operate within defined roles corresponding to specific job functions—citizen service officers, policy analysts, enforcement personnel—each with distinct tool access requirements. Without proper RBAC, an agent designed for citizen enquiries might access enforcement databases, or a policy research agent might invoke transaction processing tools. This is particularly critical in Singapore's whole-of-government context where agents may need to interact with tools across multiple agencies through central WOG services.
  wog_examples:
    - Citizen enquiry agent on LifeSG is granted access to CPF backend tools without role restrictions, enabling it to view detailed contribution histories and employer information beyond what is needed for basic enquiry han dling
    - Junior officer's agent inherits the tool permissions of a senior officer's template without adjustment, gaining access to approval workflows and financial authorisation tools beyond the officer's actual authority

RISK-006:
  statement: Tool poisoning by malicious actors
  description: This risk arises when tools or their interfaces are intentionally modified,
    compromised, or replaced by malicious actors to introduce harmful or deceptive
    behaviour when invoked by an agent. As a result, the agent may unknowingly execute
    malicious actions, leak sensitive information, or produce manipulated outputs
    that undermine system integrity and trust.

  wog_description: Agencies may deploy MCP servers and custom tools from various sources including vendor-provided solutions and open-source repositories. A poisoned tool in the government ecosystem could compromise data integrity, manipulate citizen service outcomes, or exfiltrate sensitive government data.
  wog_examples:
    - Agency downloads open-source MCP server for document processing from GitHub; the repository was compromised weeks earlier, and the tool silently exfiltrates uploaded citizen documents to an external endpoint before processing them normally
    - Vendor-provided income verification tool used by grants processing agent contains hidden logic that inflates reported income for applicants matching certain profiles, causing legitimate low-income citizens to be incorrectly assessed as ineligible for financial assistance
    - Agency deploys third-party MCP server for language translation to support multi-lingual citizen services; the tool appears to function normally but secretly logs all input text containing NRIC patterns or financial amounts to external servers

RISK-007:
  statement: Lack of input sanitisation
  description: This risk arises when inputs passed from the agent to tools are not
    properly validated or sanitised, allowing malformed or malicious data to be processed.
    As a result, tools may be exploited through injection attacks, unintended command
    execution, or data corruption.

  wog_description: Government agents process inputs from citizens, external systems, and inter-agency communications. Without proper sanitisation, these inputs could exploit vulnerabilities in connected government systems. Given that government tools often have elevated privileges to access citizen data and could perform statutory functions, successful injection attacks could have severe consequences for data integrity and system security. 
  wog_examples:
    - Citizen asks grants assistance agent to "check my eligibility; DROP TABLE applications;--" and the agent passes this unsanitised input directly to its database query tool, executing the SQL injection and deleting pending grant applications
    - User instructs document retrieval agent to fetch "../../config/database_credentials.yaml" and the agent passes the path to its file access tool without validation, exposing sensitive configuration files through path traversal
    - Agent receives citizen's uploaded resume for job matching service; the resume contains hidden prompt injection text that, when passed unsanitised to the parsing tool, causes the agent to email the citizen's match results to an attacker-controlled address

RISK-008:
  statement: Vague or underspecified instructions
  description: This risk arises when instructions provided to an LLM are ambiguous,
    incomplete, or poorly scoped, leading the model to make unintended assumptions
    when interpreting tasks or constraints. As a result, the LLM may behave unpredictably,
    bypass safeguards, or take actions that introduce safety or security risks.

  wog_description: Government agents require precise instructions to operate within statutory boundaries, policy guidelines, and service standards. Vague instructions in the public sector context can lead agents to make assumptions about eligibility criteria, approval thresholds, or escalation procedures that contradict official policy. This is particularly risky when agents handle discretionary decisions, means-testing calculations, or cross-agency referrals where the boundaries of authority must be clearly defined.
  wog_examples:
    - MOH health advisory agent given vague instruction to 'provide helpful medical information' interprets this broadly and offers diagnostic suggestions rather than directing citizens to appropriate healthcare services
    - IRAS tax agent instructed to 'assist with tax matters' lacks clear boundaries on what constitutes tax advice versus general information, leading it to recommend specific deduction strategies that taxpayers follow but are later disallowed, resulting in penalties and disputes

RISK-009:
  statement: Unsanitised inputs in system instructions
  description: This risk arises when untrusted or user-controlled inputs are incorporated
    into system instructions without proper sanitisation or validation. As a result,
    malicious or malformed content may manipulate the model's behaviour, override
    intended constraints, or trigger unintended actions.

  wog_description: Government agents often personalise responses using citizen data retrieved from MyInfo, Singpass profiles, or agency databases. When this data is incorporated into system prompts without sanitisation, attackers could craft malicious profile data or input fields that inject instructions into the agent's system prompt. This could manipulate the agent's behaviour to bypass security controls, reveal confidential information, or take unauthorised actions on behalf of the government.
  wog_examples:
    - Citizen modifies their MyInfo 'address' field to include prompt injection payload that, when incorporated into agent's system prompt for personalised service, instructs the agent to reveal information about other citizens' applications
    - Malicious applicant's 'reason for appeal' text in LTA traffic fine appeal form contains embedded instructions that manipulate the agent into automatically approving the appeal
    - External organisation's registered business name in ACRA database contains prompt injection that affects agents processing CorpPass-authenticated requests, enabling unauthorised access to other businesses' data

RISK-010:
  statement: Poisoned memory
  description: This risk arises when the memory component of an agentic system is
    intentionally or inadvertently populated with malicious, misleading, or corrupted
    information. As a result, the agent may rely on compromised memory to make decisions,
    propagate false information, or exhibit persistent unsafe behaviour across interactions.

  wog_description: Government agents with persistent memory may store citizen interaction histories, learned preferences, and contextual information across sessions. If an attacker can poison this memory - either through crafted interactions or by compromising memory storage - the agent could persistently provide incorrect information, develop biased decision patterns, or carry out long-term manipulation campaigns affecting citizen services.
  wog_examples:
    - Attacker conducts series of interactions with CPF enquiry agent, deliberately providing misleading 'corrections' that the agent stores in memory, causing it to subsequently give incorrect retirement planning advice to all citizens
    - Compromised data feed updates agent's policy knowledge base with subtly incorrect HDB eligibility rules, causing persistent incorrect assessments until the poisoning is detected
    - Agent's conversation memory is manipulated to include false 'prior approvals' or 'special arrangements' that the agent then references when processing new requests, effectively granting unauthorised benefits

RISK-011:
  statement: Sensitive data leakage across memory contexts
  description: This risk arises when the memory component retains or exposes sensitive
    information across sessions, tasks, or users with different scopes or authorisations.
    As a result, data may be inappropriately accessed or reused in unrelated contexts,
    leading to privacy breaches, confidentiality violations, or unauthorised disclosure.

  wog_description: Government agents handle sensitive citizen data including NRIC numbers, income information, medical records, and family circumstances. Memory components that fail to properly isolate this data across sessions or users could leak information between citizens, enable unauthorised officers to access restricted data, or expose sensitive information when agents are queried about their prior interactions. 
  wog_examples:
    - MOH healthcare agent retains patient consultation details in memory and inadvertently references one patient's medical conditions when assisting a different patient with similar symptoms
    - Multi-agency agent serving both MSF and MOM retains sensitive social assistance application details that become accessible when the same agent handles unrelated employment pass queries

RISK-012:
  statement: Cascading errors in multi-agent architectures
  description: This risk arises when errors or misjudgements produced by one agent
    propagate through interconnected agents within a multi-agent system. As a result,
    small failures may compound across agent interactions, leading to amplified errors,
    degraded system performance, or unintended outcomes at the system level.

  wog_description: Singapore's whole-of-government service delivery often requires multi-agent coordination across agencies - a citizen's grant application might involve agents from MSF, IRAS, HDB, and CPF working together. Errors in one agent's assessment can cascade through the workflow, compounding at each stage. For example, an incorrect income verification from IRAS could affect MSF assistance eligibility, HDB grant calculations, and CPF top-up recommendations simultaneously.
  wog_examples:
    - IRAS income verification agent makes error in annual income calculation, which cascades to MSF ComCare agent (incorrect assistance amount), HDB agent (wrong housing grant tier), and CPF agent (inappropriate retirement advice) in integrated citizen service workflow
    - ICA immigration status check returns outdated information, cascading through MOM work pass agent, CPF contribution agent, and IRAS tax residency agent, affecting multiple citizen service outcomes

RISK-013:
  statement: Man-in-the-middle attacks between agents
  description: This risk arises when communication channels between agents are insufficiently
    secured, allowing an attacker to intercept, modify, or replay messages exchanged

  wog_description: Inter-agency agent communications in Singapore's whole-of-government architecture may traverse different network segments, from agency intranets to GCC infrastructure to external partner networks. Attackers intercepting these communications could modify citizen data in transit, alter approval decisions, or inject false instructions. The risk is heightened for agents exchanging sensitive information like NRIC-linked data, financial details, or approval tokens.
  wog_examples:
    - Attacker intercepts communication between MOM work pass agent and ICA security clearance agent, modifying the security status response to approve applications that should have been flagged for additional review
    - Man-in-the-middle attack on agent-to-agent API calls between MSF and IRAS modifies income declaration data, enabling fraudulent qualification for social assistance programmes
    - Replay attack captures valid approval token from HDB agent and reuses it to authorise transactions for different applicants, bypassing proper verification workflows

RISK-014:
  statement: Feedback loops and runaway agent behaviour
  description: This risk arises when agents repeatedly reinforce each other's decisions,
    outputs, or errors within an agentic architecture. As a result, feedback loops

  wog_description: Multi-agent government systems processing high volumes of citizen transactions could develop feedback loops where agents repeatedly validate each other's outputs without independent verification. In automated workflows for grants, permits, or enforcement actions, such loops could result in mass incorrect approvals, denial of legitimate applications, or resource exhaustion on government infrastructure.
  wog_examples:
    - "Automated MSF-IRAS verification loop repeatedly requests income confirmation for edge cases, generating thousands of API calls that overwhelm both agencies' systems during grant processing period"
    - "HDB and CPF agents enter circular verification loop when processing complex joint-ownership cases, each requesting confirmation from the other indefinitely without resolving the query"

Overly permissive roles could enable agents to access citizen data across agencies unnecessarily, invoke financial transaction tools beyond their operational scope, or modify system configurations that should require elevated approval. The interconnected nature of Singapore's digital government amplifies the impact of excessive permissions."

  wog_examples:
    - "Citizen enquiry agent is granted full access to IRAS taxpayer database including sensitive audit flags and enforcement records, when it only requires access to basic tax filing status for enquiry handling"
    - "Document processing agent receives administrative privileges on GCC infrastructure to facilitate testing, but these permissions are not revoked before production deployment"
    - "Inter-agency data sharing agent is configured with write access to partner agency databases when read-only access would suffice for its designated function"

  description: This risk arises when agents are able to gain elevated roles or permissions
    beyond those initially granted, whether through misconfiguration, exploitation,

  wog_description: "Whole-of-government service delivery requires accurate routing of tasks to appropriate agency agents with correct capabilities and authorisations. Incorrect delegation—sending tax queries to housing agents, or delegating enforcement actions to enquiry-handling agents—wastes resources, delays service delivery, and may result in inappropriate actions being taken by agents lacking the necessary context or authority."

  wog_examples:
    - "Orchestrator agent incorrectly delegates CPF withdrawal request to HDB agent based on keyword matching ('housing'), despite the request actually concerning CPF investment scheme withdrawal"
    - "Cross-agency coordination agent assigns MOH-specific patient record queries to MSF social services agent, which lacks access permissions and medical data handling protocols"
    - "Multi-agent workflow incorrectly delegates LTA traffic fine processing to NEA environmental enforcement agent due to ambiguous jurisdiction keywords in citizen complaint"

RISK-022:
  statement: Malicious or manipulative use of delegated agents
  description: This risk arises when an agent deliberately assigns tasks to other
    agents in ways intended to bypass controls, obscure responsibility, or achieve
    malicious objectives. As a result, delegated agents may be coerced into performing
    unauthorised actions, amplifying harmful behaviour or evading detection within
    the system.

  wog_description: "In multi-agent government architectures, a compromised or manipulated agent could abuse delegation capabilities to launder requests through trusted agents, bypass access controls, or distribute malicious operations across multiple agents to evade detection. The trust relationships between government agents make such manipulation particularly dangerous."

  wog_examples:
    - "Compromised enquiry agent crafts delegation requests that manipulate downstream agents into revealing citizen data that the enquiry agent itself is not authorised to access"
    - "Attacker manipulates orchestrator agent to delegate small pieces of a fraudulent transaction across multiple agents, none of which detect the malicious intent when viewing only their portion"
    - "Agent exploits delegation mechanism to fragment a prohibited action (e.g., bulk data export) into many small requests distributed across agents, evading per-agent rate limits and monitoring thresholds"

RISK-023:
  statement: Incorrect tool selection or misuse
  description: This risk arises when an agent selects an inappropriate tool or applies
    a tool incorrectly for a given task or action. As a result, the agent may produce

  wog_description: "Government agents access numerous tools through APEX Cloud, MCP servers, and direct integrations—from data retrieval APIs to transaction processing systems. Selecting the wrong tool or misusing tool parameters could result in incorrect citizen data being retrieved, wrong calculations being applied, or unintended transactions being initiated. The consequences range from service delays to incorrect statutory decisions."

  wog_examples:

    safeguards. As a result, confidential data may be disclosed to unauthorised parties,
    leading to privacy breaches, regulatory non-compliance, or loss of trust.

  wog_description: "Government agents with database access may retrieve citizen PII including NRIC numbers, income details, medical records, and family information. Without proper safeguards, this data could be exposed through agent outputs, logs, or subsequent interactions. Public agencies must protect citizen data consistent with Public Sector Governance Act requirements even though PDPA exemptions apply."

  wog_examples:
    - "Agent querying NEHR patient records for healthcare research includes raw PII in its analysis output, exposing patient identities when the research summary is shared with external collaborators"
    - "Database query agent retrieves IRAS income data for statistical analysis but fails to anonymise results, enabling individual taxpayer identification from the aggregated report"
    - "File processing agent extracts text from MSF case files containing sensitive family circumstances and includes these details in response to unrelated enquiry from different officer"

RISK-044:
  statement: Prompt injection via malicious files or data
  description: This risk arises when an agent ingests or processes maliciously crafted
    files or data that embed hidden instructions or manipulative content. As a result,
    the agent may follow unintended prompts, alter its behaviour, or execute actions
    that compromise system safety or integrity.

  wog_description: "Government agents processing citizen-submitted documents, business applications, or external data feeds may encounter files crafted to inject malicious instructions. In Singapore's context, this could affect agents processing documents through LifeSG, business filings through BizFile+, or inter-agency data exchanges. Successful injection could manipulate processing outcomes or exfiltrate sensitive information."

  wog_examples:
    - "Citizen submits PDF supporting document for HDB application containing hidden text with prompt injection that causes processing agent to automatically approve the application"
    - "Business submits ACRA annual return with embedded instructions in metadata that manipulate the verification agent's assessment of filing completeness"
    - "Data file received through inter-agency sharing contains prompt injection payload that, when processed by receiving agent, causes it to forward sensitive records to unauthorised recipients"

RISK-045:
  statement: Misconfiguration of system resources
  description: This risk arises when an agent incorrectly configures system settings,
    infrastructure resources, or operational parameters. As a result, system performance,
    reliability, or security may be degraded, leading to service disruptions or unintended
    operational behaviour.

  wog_description: "Government agents managing GCC infrastructure, agency application settings, or system configurations could introduce misconfigurations that affect service availability, security posture, or compliance status. Given Singapore's high digital service adoption, misconfigurations could impact millions of citizens relying on government services."

  wog_examples:
    - "Infrastructure agent adjusting GCC Auto Scaling parameters sets incorrect minimum instance count, causing citizen portal to become unresponsive during routine traffic spikes"
    - "Security configuration agent misapplies IM8 baseline settings, inadvertently opening network ports that create security vulnerabilities on production systems"
    - "Database agent modifying PostgreSQL configuration parameters introduces settings incompatible with production workload, causing connection timeouts during peak periods"

RISK-046:
  statement: System overload due to inefficient or excessive operations
  description: This risk arises when an agent issues poorly optimised, excessively
    frequent, or redundant system-level operations or queries. As a result, computing
    resources may be exhausted, system performance may degrade, or services may become
    unavailable due to unnecessary load.

  wog_description: "Government infrastructure must support consistent service delivery to Singapore's citizens. Agents performing excessive API calls, redundant system queries, or resource-intensive operations could degrade GCC performance, exhaust compute budgets, or cause cascading failures across interconnected government services. This is particularly critical during high-demand periods like tax filing deadlines or national registration exercises."

  wog_examples:
    - "Monitoring agent enters retry loop when encountering transient errors, generating thousands of API calls per minute that exhaust rate limits and trigger GCC cost alerts"
    - "Data synchronisation agent performs full database scans hourly instead of incremental updates, consuming excessive compute resources and impacting co-hosted services"
    - "Log analysis agent processes historical logs inefficiently, consuming all available memory on the analysis instance and causing out-of-memory failures for other workloads"
