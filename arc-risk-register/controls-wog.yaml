For agencies using self-hosting models, use well-maintained, community-vetted model loading libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, PyTorch, TensorFlow) and avoid custom or unmaintained deserialisation code. Use only approved LLM loaders, inference frameworks and weight formats such as safetensors. If loading pickle-based models is necessary, scan model files using tools such as ProtectAI ModelScan or picklescan before deployment, recognising these tools have known bypass techniques. Maintain approved models in an internal registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Azure Container Registry) rather than auto-downloading from external sources at runtime. Verify model weights integrity via checksums.

Obtain and review the model's system card before deployment, paying particular attention to documented risks, benchmark performance on safety evaluations, and limitations relevant to your use case. For citizen-facing applications, pay particular attention to documented limitations around multi-lingual support (English, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil) and cultural context relevant to Singapore. Use this information to identify potential misalignment between model behaviour and application requirements, and to inform additional safeguards or testing strategies. If a system card is unavailable or incomplete, consider this a red flag when assessing provider trustworthiness.

Agencies should use GovTech's Litmus platform to conduct safety and security testing, and integrate testing with CI/CD pipelines to enable continuous testing on application changes. Supplement testing with evaluation datasets that include use case-specific scenarios such as multilingual citizen service interactions and sensitive topics (race, religion, politics) to ensure appropriate handling of edge cases.

Statutory duties conferred on agencies or officers by legislation must remain with human decision-makers and cannot be delegated to AI agents. For financial transactions, ensure approval workflows respect Financial Procedure Act requirements. For citizen communications, require officer approval before sending official notices or decisions.

  recommendations: Comprehensive logging enables post-incident analysis, safety monitoring, detection of adversarial inputs, and continuous improvement of LLM behaviour over time. Agencies should log both system health metrics (resource usage, error rates, availability) and agent performance metrics (LLM inputs/outputs, tool calls, decision traces, timestamps, model versions) to enable comprehensive monitoring. For agent-specific observability, consider self-hostable tools such as Langfuse or Arize Phoenix that can be deployed on GCC to maintain data sovereignty. Leverage GCC logging infrastructure for centralised log management with appropriate retention policies and access controls. Ensure logging configuration complies with IM8 audit logging requirements. For applications processing sensitive data, implement log redaction to mask sensitive information like NRIC numbers and other PII while preserving operational visibility. Establish regular review processes—manual spot-checks or automated anomaly detection—to identify drift, unsafe outputs, or emerging failure patterns. Consider integration with central platforms like StackOps, WOGAA, and ABLR for logging analytics.

Implement monitoring systems that continuously track these metrics and trigger alerts when deviations exceed thresholds. Consider Datadog LLM Observability or Grafana Cloud for managed solutions, or self-hostable options like Langfuse, Arize Phoenix, or Grafana OSS on GCC.

If a server is not listed, agencies must perform the full authentication verification and validation below and document evidence of compliance before use. Verify that MCP servers implement modern OAuth standards (OAuth 2.1 or OAuth 2.0 with PKCE) before deployment, ensuring they enforce per-client consent flows, scope restrictions, and redirect URI validation to prevent authorisation bypasses. Review the server's authentication documentation and test authorisation flows in a development environment to confirm proper implementation. Reject MCP servers that use deprecated authentication methods, hard-coded credentials, or insufficient session management. Ensure MCP servers integrate with government identity infrastructure where appropriate, such as WOG AD for internal applications, and Singpass or CorpPass for citizen-facing services.

Test this behaviour by monitoring whether the server accepts requests with expired, revoked, or missing credentials after an initial successful authentication. Ensure the server responds with appropriate HTTP 401 errors when credentials are invalid, expired, or absent. Document validation testing as part of security assessment.

Agencies should apply the principle of least privilege aligned with IM8 access control requirements. Use ephemeral or time-bound credentials where possible rather than long-lived API keys - consider workload identity federation mechanisms (AWS IRSA, Azure/GCP Workload Identity) such that the agent's runtime environment obtains short-lived, 15-minute narrowly-scoped credentials from a cloud Security Token Service (STS) just-in-time for a specific task, limiting the value of leaked credentials. Document scope justifications as part of application security documentation. Periodically audit active token scopes to identify and revoke excessive permissions.

The authorisation server should clearly identify the requesting client and display what data or actions are being requested during the consent flow (e.g., even if client is authorised for tool A, it requires separate authorisation for tool B, even if they are both in the same MCP server). Ensure the authorisation server persists consent decisions and provides mechanisms to review and revoke previously granted permissions.

Monitor server activity during testing for anomalous network connections, excessive resource consumption, unauthorised file access, or other suspicious behaviours.

Use consistent, distinctive delimiters that are unlikely to appear naturally in user input.
