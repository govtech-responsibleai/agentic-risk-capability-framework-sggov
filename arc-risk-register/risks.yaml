RISK-001:
  statement: Use of untrusted or compromised LLMs
  description: This risk arises when LLMs obtained from untrusted or insufficiently
    vetted sources have been intentionally poisoned or backdoored during training
    or distribution, causing them to behave maliciously or unpredictably under specific
    conditions. Such models may leak sensitive information, bypass safeguards, or
    execute hidden behaviors that undermine system integrity and trust.

  statement: Database overload due to inefficient data operations
  description: This risk arises when an agent issues poorly optimised, excessively
    frequent, or redundant queries against databases or data stores. As a result,
    system performance may degrade, resources may be exhausted, or critical services
    may become unavailable due to unnecessary load.

RISK-043:
  statement: Exposure of sensitive data through file or database access
  description: This risk arises when an agent accesses, processes, or outputs personally
    identifiable or sensitive information stored in files or databases without appropriate
    safeguards. As a result, confidential data may be disclosed to unauthorised parties,
    leading to privacy breaches, regulatory non-compliance, or loss of trust.

RISK-044:
  statement: Prompt injection via malicious files or data
  description: This risk arises when an agent ingests or processes maliciously crafted
    files or data that embed hidden instructions or manipulative content. As a result,
    the agent may follow unintended prompts, alter its behaviour, or execute actions
    that compromise system safety or integrity.

RISK-045:
  statement: Misconfiguration of system resources
  description: This risk arises when an agent incorrectly configures system settings,
    infrastructure resources, or operational parameters. As a result, system performance,
    reliability, or security may be degraded, leading to service disruptions or unintended
    operational behaviour.

RISK-046:
  statement: System overload due to inefficient or excessive operations
  description: This risk arises when an agent issues poorly optimised, excessively
    frequent, or redundant system-level operations or queries. As a result, computing
    resources may be exhausted, system performance may degrade, or services may become
    unavailable due to unnecessary load.
