  wog_examples:
    - "GovTech GCC resource scaling: Agent monitors GCC compute utilisation for citizen-facing portal during peak hours, detects CPU usage exceeding 80% threshold, automatically scales EC2 instances from 4 to 8 instances using AWS Auto Scaling, adjusts load balancer configuration to distribute traffic, updates CloudWatch alarms for new capacity, and logs scaling actions to StackOps for operational visibility"
    - "HDB officer account provisioning: Agent receives request to onboard new HDB estate officer, creates Active Directory account with appropriate permissions, adds user to required security groups for HDB property management systems, configures Singpass authentication binding, sets password policy and expiry date, provisions access to shared network drives based on division, and sends account credentials via secure channel"
    - "MOE school system backup automation: Agent monitors daily backup jobs for MOE student management system, detects failed backup for primary database server, investigates log files to identify disk space exhaustion, automatically extends storage volume on GCC EBS, retriggers backup job, verifies backup integrity through test restore, updates backup retention policy to archive older backups to S3 Glacier, and alerts system administrators of remediation actions taken"

    - id: "SG-CAP-12.1"
      name: "Cloud Infrastructure Management"
      description: "Managing resources on Government Commercial Cloud platforms (AWS GCC, Azure GCC) including provisioning, configuring, scaling, and decommissioning compute instances, storage volumes, networking components, and other cloud services. This includes automated resource scaling based on demand, cost optimisation through rightsizing, infrastructure-as-code deployment, and ensuring cloud resources comply with government security baselines and IM8 requirements."
      examples:
        - "LTA transport data platform scaling: Agent monitors S3 storage usage for LTA DataMall historical traffic data, detects approaching storage quota limit, provisions additional S3 buckets with appropriate lifecycle policies, configures cross-region replication to backup GCC region for disaster recovery, applies server-side encryption with KMS keys, and updates bucket policies to maintain least-privilege access for authorised applications"
        - "IRAS tax filing infrastructure preparation: Agent forecasts compute demand for annual tax filing season based on historical patterns, pre-provisions additional RDS database read replicas two weeks before deadline, scales application tier EC2 instances from 10 to 30 using Auto Scaling Groups, increases ElastiCache cluster capacity for session management, configures CloudFront CDN for static assets, and schedules automatic scale-down after filing deadline"
        - "MOH healthcare analytics platform: Agent receives request to deploy new data analytics environment, uses Terraform to provision VPC with private subnets, launches EMR cluster with Spark for big data processing, configures S3 data lake with appropriate bucket policies and access logging, sets up IAM roles following least-privilege principle, applies mandatory security group rules per IM8 baseline, and registers resources in AWS Config for compliance monitoring"

    - id: "SG-CAP-12.2"
      name: "Security and Access Control"
      description: "Managing authentication, authorisation, identity lifecycle, and security configurations across government systems in compliance with IM8 security requirements. This includes creating and deactivating user accounts, assigning role-based access permissions, configuring multi-factor authentication, managing service accounts and API credentials, enforcing password policies, conducting access reviews, and maintaining audit logs of privileged operations."
      examples:
        - "CPF officer role-based access: Agent processes HR notification of officer's role change from operations to policy division, revokes access to CPF contribution processing system and member account databases, removes user from operational security groups in Active Directory, provisions new access to policy research systems and aggregated statistical databases, updates Singpass authentication profile with new role attributes, schedules access recertification review in 6 months, and logs all permission changes for audit"
        - "IRAS API credential rotation: Agent detects myTax Portal API service account credentials approaching 90-day expiry per IM8 requirements, generates new credentials with equivalent permissions, updates secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, coordinates with consuming applications to migrate to new credentials during maintenance window, validates connectivity and functionality post-migration, revokes old credentials after confirmation, and sends completion notification to security team"
        - "GovTech privileged access review: Agent conducts quarterly review of privileged accounts with sudo or administrator rights across GCC environments, queries IAM roles with AdministratorAccess policy, cross-references with authorised privileged user list from HR system, identifies 3 accounts belonging to transferred officers, automatically disables unused privileged accounts, notifies security team of accounts disabled, and generates compliance report for CSA audit requirements"

    - id: "SG-CAP-12.3"
      name: "System Monitoring and Incident Response"
      description: "Monitoring system health, performance metrics, security events, and operational status across government infrastructure, detecting anomalies or incidents, and executing automated remediation actions or escalations. This includes collecting telemetry from servers and applications, analysing logs for errors or threats, alerting on threshold breaches, performing automated diagnostics, triggering remediation playbooks, and maintaining operational dashboards."
      examples:
        - "NEA website availability monitoring: Agent continuously monitors NEA public website response times and availability via synthetic probes from multiple locations, detects HTTP 503 errors indicating service unavailability, automatically checks application server health metrics via StackOps, identifies crashed web server process, restarts application service using systemctl commands, verifies service restoration within 2 minutes, logs incident timeline with root cause analysis, and sends post-incident report to operations team"
        - "MOM work pass portal performance degradation: Agent monitors MOM employment pass application portal database query performance, detects average query time increasing from 200ms to 5 seconds, analyses slow query logs to identify inefficient SQL statement, triggers alert to database administrator team via PagerDuty, captures performance metrics and query execution plans, suggests index optimization for problematic table, and creates incident ticket with diagnostic information pre-populated"
        - "IRAS disk space threshold alert: Agent monitors disk utilisation across IRAS tax computation servers, detects /var/log partition reaching 85% capacity on production server, analyses log files to identify rapid growth in application logs, automatically archives logs older than 30 days to S3 archival storage, compresses recent logs to free immediate space, updates log rotation policy to prevent recurrence, verifies disk usage reduced to 65%, and documents remediation actions in ServiceNow incident ticket"
