# Baseline Risks

In this section, we list the baseline risks from (i) the components of an agent and (ii) the design of an agentic system. Note that this list is meant as a reference and is not meant to be exhaustive. Clicking on any of the risks will bring you to the next page with the corresponding controls.

## List of Baseline Risks

| Component | Risk |
|---------------|-------|
| <a name="llm-alignment-failure"></a>LLM | [Poorly aligned LLMs may pursue objectives which technically satisfy instructions but violate safety principles.](controls.md#llm-alignment-failure)[^1] |
| <a name="llm-unpredictable-performance"></a>LLM | [Weaker LLMs have a higher tendency to produce unpredictable outputs which make agent behaviour erratic.](controls.md#llm-unpredictable-performance)[^2] |
| <a name="llm-poor-safety-tuning"></a>LLM | [LLMs with poor safety tuning are more susceptible to prompt injection attacks and jailbreaking attempts.](controls.md#llm-poor-safety-tuning)[^3] |
| <a name="llm-data-contamination"></a>LLM | [Using LLMs trained on poisoned or biased data introduces manipulation risk, discriminatory decisions, or misinformation.](controls.md#llm-data-contamination)[^4] |
| <a name="tools-authentication-failure"></a>Tools | [Poorly implemented tools may not correctly verify user identity or permissions when executing privileged actions.](controls.md#tools-authentication-failure)[^5] |
| <a name="tools-rogue-malicious"></a>Tools | [Rogue tools that mimic legitimate ones can contain hidden malicious code that executes when loaded.](controls.md#tools-rogue-malicious)[^6] |
| <a name="tools-input-validation"></a>Tools | [Tools that do not properly sanitise or validate inputs can be exploited through prompt injection attacks.](controls.md#tools-input-validation)[^7] |
| <a name="tools-excessive-privileges"></a>Tools | [Tools that demand broader permissions than necessary create unnecessary attack surfaces for malicious actors.](controls.md#tools-excessive-privileges)[^8] |
| <a name="instructions-specification-gaming"></a>Instructions | [Simplistic instructions with narrow metrics and without broader constraints may result in agents engaging in specification gaming, resulting in poor performance or safety violations.](controls.md#instructions-specification-gaming)[^9] |
| <a name="instructions-underspecified"></a>Instructions | [Vague instructions may compel agents to attempt to fill in missing constraints, resulting in unpredictable actions or incorrect steps taken.](controls.md#instructions-underspecified)[^10] |
| <a name="instructions-hierarchy-confusion"></a>Instructions | [Instructions without a clear distinction between system prompts and user requests may confuse agents and result in greater vulnerability to prompt injection attacks.](controls.md#instructions-hierarchy-confusion)[^11] |
| <a name="memory-data-poisoning"></a>Memory | [Malicious actors can inject false or misleading facts into the knowledge base, resulting in the agent acting on incorrect data or facts.](controls.md#memory-data-poisoning)[^12] |
| <a name="memory-privacy-leakage"></a>Memory | [Agents may inadvertently store sensitive user or organisational data from prior interactions, resulting in data privacy risks.](controls.md#memory-privacy-leakage)[^13]|
| <a name="memory-hallucination-persistence"></a>Memory | [Agents may mistakenly save momentary glitches and hallucinations into memory, resulting in compounding mistakes when the agent relies on the incorrect information for its decision or actions.](controls.md#memory-hallucination-persistence)|
| <a name="architecture-error-propagation"></a>Agentic Architecture | [In linear agentic pipelines where each stage blindly trusts the previous stage, single early mistakes may be propagated and magnified.](controls.md#architecture-error-propagation)[^15] |
| <a name="architecture-single-point-failure"></a>Agentic Architecture | [In hub-and-spoke architectures which route all decisions through one controller agent, any bug or compromise may distributes faulty instructions across the entire system.](controls.md#architecture-single-point-failure)[^16]|
| <a name="architecture-decision-traceability"></a>Agentic Architecture | [More complex agentic architectures may make it difficult to fully reconstruct decision processes across multiple agents.](controls.md#architecture-decision-traceability)|
| <a name="access-role-impersonation"></a>Roles and Access Controls | [Unauthorised actors can impersonate agents and gain access to restricted resources.](controls.md/#access-role-impersonation)[^17] |
| <a name="access-misconfigured-roles"></a>Roles and Access Controls | [Agents may gain unauthorized access to restricted resources by exploiting misconfigured or overly permissive roles.](controls.md/#access-misconfigured-roles)[^18] |
| <a name="monitoring-failure"></a>Monitoring and Traceability | [Lack of monitoring results in delayed detection of agent failures and downstream risks.](controls.md/#monitoring-failure)[^19] |
| <a name="monitoring-audit"></a>Monitoring and Traceability | [Lack of traceability inhibit proper audit of decision-making paths in the event of failures.](controls.md/#monitoring-audit)[^18] |
